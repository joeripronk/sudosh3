.TH SUDOSH-REPLAY 8 "December 20 2007" @VERSION@ "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
sudosh-replay \- view and replay sudosh sessions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sudosh-replay [ID] [MULTIPLIER] [MAXWAIT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sudosh-replay
displays a list of previously recorded sudosh sessions.  Give sudosh-replay an argument and it will reference and replay that session ID.  Given a second argument it will be used as a multiplier.  For example if a multiplier of 2 was used the replay will be doubled.  Given a third arguement it will be used as a maximum wait.  For example if the output has long waits (if the user was away from the keyboard) the MAXWAIT would over-ride and the output would continue as normal. sudosh-replay will try to resize your xterm to conform to the recorded session.
